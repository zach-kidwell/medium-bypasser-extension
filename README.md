## How it works

When the extension is enabled, it looks for paywalled Medium articles and redirects to an archived version. It also gives you a button to manually archive the page you're on. The extension saves a list of the most recent archived links and displays them in the popup. You can clear the history if you want to start fresh. You can also choose how many links to keep in the history.

## Why I made this

Medium puts a lot of content behind a paywall, and I wanted a quick way to access articles without logging in or hitting limits. This project was also a good way to learn more about Chrome extensions, background scripts, DOM parsing, and local storage.

## Notes

This extension does **not** archive the page itself, it just redirects to an archived version if one exists (or lets you open it manually). It uses archive.is since it's reliable and doesnâ€™t require an account. If you click **View Archived Article** and there is not an archive already, you can click **archive this url**. After archiving, repeat the process and you will be able to view the archived article.
